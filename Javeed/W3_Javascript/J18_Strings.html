    // JavaScript Strings as Objects

    //Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values
    //In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.


    let nameStr = "Javeed";

    //But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
    let nameObj = new String("Javeed");

    document.write("<br><br> type of nameStr =>" + (typeof nameStr));
    document.write("<br><br> type of nameObj =>" + (typeof nameObj));

    document.write("<br><br> type of string and Object =>" + (typeof nameObj == typeof nameStr));
    document.write("<br><br> values of  string and Object by using '==' operator =>" + (nameObj == nameStr));
    document.write("<br><br> values of  string and Object by using '===' operator =>" + (nameObj === nameStr));
