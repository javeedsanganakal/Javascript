        //Adding Numbers and Strings

        // 1. JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
        // 2. Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.

        let x1 = 10;
        let y1 = 20;
        let z1 = x1 + y1; // 30



        let x2 = "10";
        let y2 = "20";
        let z2 = x2 + y2; // 1020

        let x3 = 10;
        let y3 = "20";
        let z3 = x3 + y3; //1020

        //  Numeric Strings
        // JavaScript strings can have numeric content:

        let x4 = 100;         // x4 is a number
        let y4 = "100";       // y4 is a string

        // JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations: only /, - ,* not + operator

        let x5 = "100";
        let y5 = "10";
        let z5 = x5 / y5; // 10

        let x6 = "100";
        let y6 = "10";
        let z6 = x6 * y6; // 1000

        let x7 = "100";
        let y7 = "10";
        let z7 = x7 - y7; //90


        //But this will not work:
        let x8 = "100";
        let y8 = "10";
        let z8 = x8 + y8; //10010


        //NaN - Not a Number
        // 1.Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number):

        let x9 = 100 / "Apple"; //NaN
        let x10 = 100 / "10"; //10

        isNaN(x); // true

        //If you use NaN in a mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN:
        let x11 = NaN;
        let y11 = 5;
        let z11 = x11 + y11; //NaN

        let x12 = NaN;
        let y12 = "5";
        let z12 = x12 + y12; //NaN5

        document.write("<br><br> Tyoe of NaN => " + typeof NaN);


        //Infinity
        //Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.

        let m = 2 / 0;
        let n = -2 / 0;
        document.write("<br><br> Division by zero generates Infinity : 2/0 and -2/0 => ", m + " and " + n);

        document.write("<br><br> typeof Infinity => " + typeof Infinity);

        //Hexadecimal 

        //let x = 0xFF; //255

        //JavaScript Numbers as Objects
        //Normally JavaScript numbers are primitive values created from literals:
        let a = 123;
        //But numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
        let b = new Number(123);
        let c = new Number(123);
        console.log(a, b);
        document.write("<br><br> a = 123 ,  b = new Number(123), c = new Number(123) => " + a + " and " + b);
        document.write("<br><br> a = 123 type of a: => " + typeof a);
        document.write("<br><br> b = new Number(123) type of b: => " + typeof b);
