// You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash:

"Dolly!"; // or 

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
Dolly!";



// JavaScript Strings as Objects

//Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values
//In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.


let nameStr = "Javeed";

//But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
let nameObj =  new String("Javeed");

document.write("<br><br> type of string and Object " + typeof nameObj == typeof nameStr);
